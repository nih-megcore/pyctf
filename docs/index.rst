Python access to CTF MEG datasets
=================================

Pyctf is a collection of Python and C routines used in the analysis of MEG
data, specifically geared towards reading CTF-format MEG datasets. It
includes basic reading and writing of CTF datasets from Python, accessing
markers, head position, FFT and IIR filtering, beamforming using MultiSphere
or Nolte models, and other types of MEG analysis.
