Installation instructions for pyctf.

0.  Pre-requisites: gsl, gsl-devel, blas, blas-devel, fftw, and fftw-devel.
    If you wish to use GIFTI atlases, you will also need gifticlib,
    gifticlib-devel, nifticlib, and nifticlib-devel.

    AFNI is optional but recommended.

    If you are reinstalling over an existing installation, it's recommended
    to remove the bin and lib directories, and "make clean".

1.  Review the settings in config/Makefile.config. The executables will go
    into BINDIR, and library files will go into LIBDIR.

2.  At the top level, run "make; make install".

3.  Either include the BINDIR in your $PATH, and LIBDIR in your $PYTHONPATH, or
    review the settings of DESTBIN and DESTLIB in the Makefile, and say

        make symlinks

    By default this will create links in $HOME/bin. The executables are
    already configured to use the LIBDIR directory.

4.  You may also say

        make usersite

    which installs a pyctf.pth file in a ~/.local/lib python directory.
    PYTHONPATH is not necessary in this case.
